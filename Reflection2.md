Big Data largely affects perspectives on research by changing the way we frame particular questions and process information. Not only is big data large in volume, but it also is very diverse, flexible and applies to a broad scope.  Kitchen’s article emphasizes the significance of measurement regarding big data’s ability large quantities of data. Big data introduces a new paradigm in science that emphasizes data mining and exploring through statistics. Data science can produce new measurements and apply it qualitatively, as well as quantitatively. To advance knowledge, statistical algorithms can discover certain patterns that science cannot find. This correlation that data can deduce can be much more effective than causation that is normally emphasized in the scientific method. Essentially, redeveloping hypotheses, experimenting further and forming specific models is no longer needed. 

The revolution in measurement can greatly change the way we approach the scientific method and can largely advance this field as well as many others. In the past, we have been taught overly simplified processes to describe biological phenomenon. As more experimentation is done in biology, findings stray further away from the original model. For example, although we learn about dominant and recessive genes through Mendel, more experimentation has found sex-linked genes and incomplete genes, where both traits appear phenotypically. However, big data can transform biological thinking by eliminating the need for hypotheses. Big data can analyze numbers with no background knowledge and find patterns. As an example, J. Craig Venter found thousands of new species of bacteria and other organisms when he sequenced the ocean and the air. Venter does not know much about the new species traits or their genome but using numbers he was able to find that they have a unique sequence. In this way, Big Data can increase the amount of data available for analysis, but it will not be the only method used for science and the humanities. Often, targeted studies are needed to answer specific questions. Similarly, Big Data can be used in any field to answer broad questions and can greatly advance other fields. 

Data science will greatly contribute to our understanding of human development with the vast amount of information it provides. By discovering patterns that would normally be overlooked by humans, data can introduce new solutions to social and economic issues. Using numbers, data is able to evaluate complex topics.  This will greatly help develop our understanding of human development. Additionally, it can change how governance is enacted and how businesses are run. Overall, big data employs the use of measurements and emphasizes the importance of correlation. Without any context, data science can identify patterns and make new discoveries.
