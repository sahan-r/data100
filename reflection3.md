1)Amartya Sen refers to development as expanding the choices and freedoms of people so that they can live a fulfilling life. The citizens are able to participate in the community, have an appropriate standard of living and knowledge is accessible. Essentially, development needs to be analyzed by observing whether it creates situations where people have the ability to choose, enlarged capabilities and increased freedoms. This is in addition to looking at how average incomes increase. Owen Barder extends this by arguing that development should be looked at as a trait of the economic and social institutions by themselves. He claims that we cannot reduce development to simply the sum of improvements in the citizens’ well-being and the outputs of firms, even though it is important to look at how it impacts people. 

2) The example of Thomas Thwaites shows how development is not only the sum of the well-being of people, but should be defined as economic, social and political systems. Thomas Thwaites was a design student who attempted to build an electric toaster from scratch. He tried to find the raw materials used to make toasters and he first found a model toaster. He got the cheapest toaster, which was about six dollars and very simple. However, the toaster was not actually as simple as Thwaites assumed, since it contained more than 400 parts and consisted of hundreds of types of material. Thwaites went through many challenges to make the toaster, such as difficulties in smelting the steel and obtaining oil. Thwaites took nine months to construct the toaster and it had a high cost. Additionally, the toaster only functioned for five seconds before combusting. This showed how building something as simple and cheap as a toaster needs a full range of different materials. To build this, the economy needs to be developed enough to supply all of the parts. The example ultimately relates back to development because it shows that development is not simply an addition in output by an individual firm. It is actually the functioning of economic, financial, legal, social and political systems, as well as firms, products and technologies. All of this work together to give the people the ability to live well. 

3) Past economic models have considered economic development as the “sum of what happens to individuals and firms in the economy.” One model (Harrod-Domar growth model) indicates that economists used said that output can be increased if the capital and labor used increases. Walter Rostow also had a model, where he showed the stages of economic growth. He said that development is a cycle, so when investment increases, capital stock increases, and output increases. This leads to greater income. These models were used widely to determine the amount of aid given to foreign areas. However, these models do not explain situations like why South Korea grew quickly, and Ghana did not. Another model incorporated technical change, which was an improvement, but depends slowly on the growth of technology and it is unlikely that technology is the only basis of difference. Overall, most of the past economic models were not very accurate and not successful because they ignored a systemic perspective. 

4) Steve Jones is an evolutionary biologist he first made soap powder at a factory. He worked to design a more efficient nozzle to make soap powder. The difficulty in developing this model was that fluid dynamics is not linear, so it is challenging to model. Jones tried to approach the problem by using a nozzle that is normally used and making copies of them. He then changes each of the copies randomly and tested the variants to determine which worked best. He was able to design a nozzle that worked much better this way and was hundreds of times more efficient. This is an example of adaptive change because there was huge jump in the solution.


5) A complex adaptive system emphasizes that the economy is complex and non-linear. The economy and society is made up of many adaptive agents that coevolve together. The five features of a complex, adaptive system are that they are very difficult to predict in detail, they make general predictions about the whole system, they have emergent characteristics, they approach greater complexity and they do not shift to an equilibrium. Since, the system is nonlinear, a small change will result in a series of changes in other places (domino effect). Additionally, they have broad patterns, and these patterns are not correlated with an individual part of it. For example, even though there are thunderstorms, an individual raindrop is not stormy (emergent property). Complex adaptive systems can be stable for a long time, but then can randomly make a huge change, so it does not shift to an equilibrium.  


6) Haile Selassie was the last Emperor in the feudal dynasty of Ethiopia. Selassie would get reports from secret police and essentially all decisions were made by the Emperor. The questions also came from the top down and telling the Emperor about poverty on the countryside was not safe. Ethiopia exemplifies suppression of systemic change because the regime only existed by taking economic value from the population. Additionally, efforts to shift to an inclusive society were suppressed because the powerful elite benefited from the existing economic structure. Therefore, they suppressed the evolution of a more equal institution. 

7) Barder recommends that we resist engineering because it is challenging to engineer effective solutions in a complex adaptive system. This is because the improvements that evolution brings about outperforms what design can do. Additionally, it is very difficult to infer what will happen as a result of change. Isomorphic mimicry is one part of the evolutionary theory. This behavior refers to when animals evolve to look like a more dangerous animal even if they are not. This allows them to avoid being preyed on, since they may look poisonous, and it saves energy. This relates to development because it is simpler to produce organizations or institutions that mimic capable organizations, but do not actually function. They do not have the parts to actually perform well. Even though these institutions follow “textbook guidelines” and assume the most efficient practices, they do not actually connect with the particular region, so they are not useful. 

8) When Barder discusses resisting fatalism, he discusses how we should not have to accept any outcome in the process of evolution. Instead, we need to hasten and shape evolution. Norman Borlaug interfered with evolution by making high-yield wheat that was resistant to disease. He did this by utilizing crossbreeding and artificially selecting varieties that were high-yield. This made a great impact by saving billions of people from starving. In this way, Borlaug brought about the Green Revolution, which was a series of initiatives based on technology that aimed to increase agricultural production globally. Overall, Barder emphasizes that development is not simply a process of natural selection. We can shape evolution ourselves if we use smart interventions.
