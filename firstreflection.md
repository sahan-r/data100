Reflection One

	While using data to address humanitarian issues can make a widespread impact, it is important to understand the environments where the program is being 
executed. This will ensure that programs are tailored to those who actually need it. Blumenstock uses various examples of the many areas data science can
contribute to. With the increasing amount of people owning cellphones, digital footprints can be used to identify individuals in poverty or assist in 
natural disaster relief efforts. For example, satellites can be used to recognize the “thatched roofs” that impoverished people tend to live in. Other 
characterizing data can be the number of international calls made. This information can be useful since current interventions are not very effective, as 
most of the money intended for the impoverished does not actually reach them (only 8%). Additionally, digital signatures can be used to identify those 
affected by disease and natural disasters based on where they live. All of this shows how data science can help execute more specific and effective solutions 
for many societal problems. However, there are disadvantages to using digital footprints and it is important to address that they exist and see how they can be 
minimized 
	The largest disadvantage of using the data obtained from digital signatures is it does not understand the people and only characterizes them by a
number. For example, borrowing money based on digital credit may lead to debt traps, since many borrowers do not know the interest rate at first. 
Individuals can also game the system. In this way, it may appear that they need aid when looking at data (they may have a roof that looks thatched), when 
they do not actually need it. One of the other problematic issues with using digital footprints is that disadvantaged people are underrepresented. This 
results in algorithms that are biased. For example, many programs take data from apps such as Google Maps and Facebook that require a smartphone. However, 
many people in developing countries do not have one and as a result solutions may not include data collected from these people (who tend to be disadvantaged).
Through these various examples Blumenstock shows the potential of data science, while also mentioning the drawbacks that should be considered. The article 
emphasizes that when looking from the outside, it is difficult to fully understand the scope of a particular technology and whether it will actually benefit
the intended. Data scientists do not understand the challenges that people in developing countries face. Therefore, data science should be used in 
combination with existing methods. Additionally, data scientists should be educated on environments in other countries. Some efforts that exist include
programs in Rwanda and South Africa. These programs should be spread globally to other developing countries. 
	I agree with the idea that good intent is not enough sometimes. This is because many people can abuse the opportunities that data science produces 
by gaming the system, so that it benefits the rich while further marginalizing the impoverished. Transparency on human based issues can definitely help and 
educational programs are extremely important to develop more personalized solutions. However, transparency with data-based issues may cause many people to
take advantage of these programs to benefit themselves. Finally, finding an optimal solution that balances out the advantages and disadvantages can be very
difficult and there will always be some error. However, further educating data scientists and using mixed methods can minimize the disadvantages and ensure
that digital footprints can have positive effects globally.
