## Reflection

In Geoff West’s reading, he explains the large and numerous applications of scaling relationships. Essentially, these relationships can be used to quantitatively characterize aspects of organisms, cities, and companies and show how they can be scaled by size. These relationships can be used to develop a better understanding of life processes. One of the examples that West indicates is determining why there is variation in the amount of time organisms tend to sleep. This also relates to the question of why humans can only survive until 120 years. While discussing this, West explains how biological processes like sleep are fundamentally related to metabolic rates. This is the amount of energy that is needed for an organism to survive. He also addresses a new concept called the social metabolic rate. While we fundamentally need food or energy to survive, we also need services like homes, lighting, airplanes, automobiles, and computers that are necessary as social beings. This drastically raises the amount of energy needed for us to maintain our lives. As humans, most of our metabolic energy is used to construct communities and innovative ideas. West continues to describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which addresses entropy. This concept explains that when energy is used, a system tends towards a more disordered form. West concludes this example by discussing that even though energy is required to sustain life processes, this comes along with the inevitable byproduct of disorder. These life processes can all be related to the function of metabolic rate and directly relate to aging and sustainability of many life processes.

Another example that Geoff West illustrates is in regard to the development and sustainability of cities. He first refers to the idea that all mammals are scaled up versions of a single “idealized mammal.” Similarly, this could potentially be applied to cities. Even though each of these cities have their own culture, history, and geography that shape them, West questions if they can all be scaled up versions of a blueprint city. For example, New York can be San Francisco scaled-up and San-Francisco may be Boise scaled up. West uses evidence from data to support this. Data has demonstrated that city infrastructure as a function of population size has a scale that is extremely similar in different countries. The infrastructures refer to characteristics, like the number of gas stations and lengths of roads, that describe the city as a whole. These correlations show that less electric cables and roads are necessary as a city grows. Additionally, socioeconomic numbers, like wages, patents, cases of AIDS, and crime, also scale as a function of population size. West concludes that even though cities have different histories, they are scales of one another in terms of infrastructure and socioeconomics. 

A third example that West illustrates is the application of quantitative and predictive variables in terms of companies. He asks if large companies like Walmart are simply largely scaled versions of small businesses, even though their revenue is far greater. West argues that even though there is a lot of variation and individuality in companies, they still function under similar constraints that generally apply to all companies and these principles change with size. He describes how companies grow almost exponentially at first and then their growth starts to slow down. If they continue to survive, companies stop growing in relation to gross domestic product. 

In the end of Geoff West’s reading, West emphasizes the relevance of data as it plays a huge role in various fields. Data is the foundation of making, testing and finetuning theories that aim to better understand the world. Data is necessary to build theories and complex adaptive systems. For example, to study the importance of social networks and the mobility of people, data in the form of cell phone calls are used. Obtaining data has become increasingly easier with the surge of networked devices and is extremely important in solving many issues including health care. This is because data can help lead to better understandings of fundamental mechanisms. Big data emphasizes correlation and can be used in supplement with other experimental methods to help science advance without having to develop detailed models.
